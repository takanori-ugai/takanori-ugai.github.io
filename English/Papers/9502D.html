    abstract :
    In this paper, we propose an intelligent software package distributing
    system, which receives requirements from both developers and customers.
    The system provides services to customers whether they connect with
    developer through network or not. Furthermore the system controls software
    package distribution in according to customer's requirements and optimizes
    the procedure for the distribution.
    The system consists on the software database and the software distribution
    agents The software database keeps the dependency information among the
    software packages. The information are represented by the extended AND-OR
    graph. The software distribution agents distribute softwares and the
    information in according with the software packages
    database.
