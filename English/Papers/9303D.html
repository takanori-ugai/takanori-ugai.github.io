    Abstract : We have proposed the formal specification language RLOTOS (
    Reflective LOTOS) which is an extension of LOTOS. It has <em> reflective
    computation</em>facilities and layered architecture which contains <em>object
    level</em> and <em>meta level</em> as other reflective languages. On meta level
    there is an interpreter which executes the object level description, and
    we can change the behaviour of the object level by controlling the
    interpreter. In this paper, we present an environment for the formal
    specification development in RLOTOS. The environment provides some useful
    tools for representing the meta information which is the behaviour of
    object level.
