Title : Programming in the Small with <em>Sushi</em><BR>
Authors : HORAI Hisayuki, UGAI Takanori<BR>
Publisher : ISIS Research Report<BR>
Language : Japanese
<p>

    Abstract :
    A programming style for Sushi is presented by making the smallest
    programs and construct bigger programs. The essence of the programming
    style has been discussed in the field of stream programming, but we expect
    this paper to be a good textbook for Sushi programmers.
