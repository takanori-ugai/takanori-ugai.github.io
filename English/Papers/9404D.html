    Abstract :
    In this paper, we present a structure of an intermediet server between
    clients and distributed databases. The server relays querys from clients
    to the databases and replies to clients, and data transfer between the
    servers is compressed or is translated on another protocol, which enables
    us to use distributed database on a multi protocol network. The server can
    have some functions for filtering or modifying data on databases. We can
    access distributed databases efficiently using a cluster of the servers.

    We also present an application using the proposed structural servers,
    which is for multiple NNTP servers.
