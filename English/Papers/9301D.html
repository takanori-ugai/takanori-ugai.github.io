Title : Process Programming with the Reflective Facilities<BR>
Authors : UGAI Takanori<BR>
Publisher : IPSJ SIGSE 1993,7,8<BR>
Language : Japanese
<p>
    We have proposed the formal specification language RLOTOS (Reflective
    LOTOS) which is an extension of LOTOS. It has {\em reflective computation}
    facilities and layered architecture which contains {\em object level} and
    {\em meta level} as the other reflective languages. On meta level there is
    an interpreter which executes the object level description, and we can
    change the behaviour of the object level by controlling the interpreter.
    In this paper, we present the outline of RLOTOS, and then we make some
    examples of process programming using its reflective facilities.
