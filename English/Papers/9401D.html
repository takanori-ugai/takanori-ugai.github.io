    Abstract : In this paper, we show a parallel programming language Sushi,
    focusing on the features designed to improve productivity of programmers
    using parallel computers or a cluster of single CPU computers. A program
    for such parallel computers includes how an algorithm is described, and
    how to tune this. A sushi program consists of a computation part (a set of
    process descriptions and their connections by streams) and an annotation
    part. Processes can work concurrently communicating each other by streams.
    An annotation part does not affect the algorithm of a computation part but
    controls process migration and the scheduling priority of processes. With
    the annotation, programmers can use parallel computers flexibly and
    effectively.
