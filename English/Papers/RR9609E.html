    Abstract :
    This paper presents a method for handling exceptional behaviour expressions
    in a system using RLOTOS (Reflective LOTOS), which is an extension of LOTOS
    (Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification).
    We embedded reflection or reflective computation facilities into
    the behaviour expressions of LOTOS and produced an RLOTOS interpreter
    system in the C language, which includes LOTOS executor support.
    The Reflective System has the concept of a  meta level and
    an object level.
    The meta level system deals with object-level description as data and
    executes the object-level description.
    Users can control the meta-level system by describing a special process,
    called the reflective process.
    We also show a method of handling exceptional behaviour expressions in RLOTOS
    to control the Alternating Bit Protocol.
    We describe normal behaviour expressions at the object level and
    exceptional behaviour expressions at the meta level.
    This example will help us to clarify the usefulness
    of separating descriptions into the meta level and the object level.
