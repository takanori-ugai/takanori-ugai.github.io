    Abstract :
    We developed a parallel/distributed programming language Sushi
    (Smartly User Schedulable HIgh-level language) with its Annotation
    mechanism. A Sushi program consists of two parts: the Annotation part
    and the Computation part. The former is a machine and environment-dependent
    specification for dynamic resource management, and in the latter, a
    usual domain specific algorithm is descrived. Dynamic resource management
    and performance tuning in the parallel/distributed computing
    environment can be realized flexibly by programming in the Annotation.
