    Abstract : A Sushi program consists of a computation part (a description of
    a set of processes and their connections by streams) and an annotation
    part. Processes can work concurrently communicating each other by streams.
    An annotation part does not affect the algorithm of a computation part but
    controls process migration and the scheduling priority of processes. With
    the annotation, programmers can use parallel computers flexibly and
    effectively. In this paper we present overview of the computation part of
    Sushi.
