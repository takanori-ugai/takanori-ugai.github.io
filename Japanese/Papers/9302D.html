    概要 : This paper reports on a technique for specifying concurrent
    systems by using a formal specification language with reflective
    computation mechanism. We call the specifications written by a reflective
    language reflective specifications. Our reflective language is an
    enhanced version of LOTOS (Language of Temporal Ordering Specification).
    We embedded reflection or reflective computation facilities to behaviour
    specification part of LOTOS in order to define complex behaviour in simple
    and natural way. Reflection in a program is a mechanism to access and
    modify its execution states which its executor has. Our enhanced version
    of LOTOS is called RLOTOS, and has two level architecture --- object level
    and meta level. The processes in the meta level, called meta processes,
    have the computational information and interpret the behaviour expressions
    of their object level processes. We can define meta processes in the same
    manner as LOTOS processes to control the behaviour of the object level
    processes. In this paper, we present a case study of specifying an
    operating system by using RLOTOS. Furthermore we discuss the method to
    construct comprehensive formal specifications by using reflective
    languages and explore the applicability of the reflective language to
    formal specification. The essential point of comprehensiveness is that
    the meta properties of the system such as control characteristics can be
    specified separately from the object level properties.
